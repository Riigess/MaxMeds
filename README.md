# MaxMeds
A web application designed to help make sure my dog (Max) is not given too many pills while he's still recovering from jumping out of a truck.

## Story
Basically, family went out to a beach in another state. While stuck in traffic, the window got rolled down too far in favor of the dog having a good time. The window did not get rolled back up once traffic started to ease up, and the dog jumped out of the moving truck while the vehicle was going about 50 mph.
